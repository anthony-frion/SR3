# SR3

Easy Colab notebook to perform super-resolution on your own images

This is just a slight modification from what you can find here : https://github.com/Janspiry/Image-Super-Resolution-via-Iterative-Refinement
I changed a few lines in a way that, in my opinion, makes it more straightforward to run the code on anyone's Colab session.

To run the code, download the notebook SR3.ipynb, then open Google Colab in your browser (https://colab.research.google.com/) and upload it back there to open the notebook in Colab. From here the notebook should give you all the necessary instructions. If you have any issue, feel free to contact me at anthony.frion@imt-atlantique.fr
